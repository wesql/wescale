//   - Results are not shared between queued transactions.
//   - Only one waiting transaction and not all are notified when the current one
//     has finished.
//   - Waiting transactions are woken up in FIFO order.

//     limited to avoid that queued transactions can consume the full capacity
//     of vttablet. This is important if the capaciy is finite. For example, the
//     number of RPCs in flight could be limited by the RPC subsystem.
