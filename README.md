# Vitess 

wesql-scale is designed to enhance the scalability, performance, security, and resilience of your applications. 
By managing connections, read-write-split, read-after-write-consistency, load balancing, wesql-scale offers 
a valuable tool for developers and database administrators.

# Features

## Connection Management
wesql-scale efficiently manages connections to your database, reducing the overhead on your application 
and improving performance. wesql-scale relieves you of the worry of the max_connection problem in your database.

## Read Write Split
wesql-scale simplify application logic by automatically routing read queries to read-only nodes 
and write queries to the primary node. This is achieved by parsing and analyzing SQL statements, 
which ensures efficient use of available resources.

## Read After Write Consistency
When an application writes data to the primary node and subsequently reads it on a read-only node, 
wesql-scale makes sure that the data that was just written to the primary node can be accessed 
and read from the read-only node.

## Load Balancing
The proxy intelligently routes queries to the appropriate read-only nodes using various load balancing policies. 
This ensures that the workload is evenly distributed across all available nodes, optimizing performance 
and resource utilization
