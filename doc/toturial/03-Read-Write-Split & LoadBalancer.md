# Introduction

WeSQL-Scale simplifies application logic by automatically routing read queries to read-only nodes and write queries to the read-write node. This is achieved by parsing and analyzing SQL statements, which improves load balancing and ensures efficient use of available resources.

WeSQL-Scale also helps manage read-only nodes by routing queries to the appropriate node using various load balancing policies. This ensures that the workload is evenly distributed across all available nodes, optimizing performance and resource utilization.

The goal of this tutorial is to explain how to enable read-write-splitting and load balancing functionality for WeSQL-Scale.

# Setting through the set command.

If you have already set up a cluster and want to enable read-write splitting and load balancing, the simplest way is using the MySQL "set" command:

```
# session
set session read_write_splitting_policy='random';

# global
set global read_write_splitting_policy='random';

```

Currently, WeSQL-Scale supports these load balancing policies:

| disable | Do not enable read/write separation |
| --- | --- |
| random | Randomly allocate read traffic |
| least_qps | WeSQL-Scale will record the QPS sent to backend MySQL in its own memory and redirect requests to the MySQL with the lowest QPS. |
| least_global_qps | WeSQL-Scale will periodically pull the QPS of all MySQLs and redirect requests to the MySQL with the lowest QPS. The difference with least_qps is that least_global_qps obtains QPS from the backend MySQL instead of tracking it themselves. |
| least_rt | WeSQL-Scale will record the execution time of all SQL queries and redirect requests to the MySQL with the lowest response time (RT). |
| least_behind_primar | WeSQL-Scale will periodically pull the GTIDs of all MySQLs and redirect requests to the MySQL with the most up-to-date GTID. |

# Setting via launch parameters

If you need to set the default value of read_write_splitting_policy, you can pass it as a startup parameter for the vtgate process:

```
vtgate \
    # enable read-write-splitting and load balancing
    --read_write_splitting_policy random
    # other necessary command line options
    ...

```

# Read-Write-Splitting Forwarding Rules

  - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT FOR UPDATE.
  - All DDL operations (creating/dropping tables/databases, altering table structures, permissions, etc.).
  - All requests within a transaction.
  - Requests that use temporary tables.
  - Requests that use GET_LOCK/RELEASE_LOCK/IS_USED_LOCK/RELEASE_ALL_LOCKS/IS_FREE_LOCK.
  - SELECT last_insert_id() statements.
  - All SHOW commands (preferably specifying a specific node).
  - information_schema, performance_schema, mysql, sys databases.
  - LOAD DATA statements.
- Sent to read-only or primary instances
  - SELECT statements outside of a transaction.
  - COM_STMT_EXECUTE commands.
- Only sent to VTGate layer
